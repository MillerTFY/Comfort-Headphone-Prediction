# Using DAD Exploratory Life Cycle and Predictive modeling for product development.

Introduction:
I have accrued significant experience in the audio peripherals industry over several years. My team and I are driven by a desire to design and deliver products that offer significant value-addition, meeting and exceeding customers' expectations. Our key priority is to delight and satisfy our customers.

In early 2017, our management tasked us with the challenging mission of investigating and developing the most comfortable headphone. This exploratory project presented us with significant hurdles, as we lacked relevant knowledge, guidelines, or data to initiate the project. Over the years, we worked diligently to comprehend the quantification of customers' pain points, and to identify sources of data for effective data collection. Through extensive research, we recognized the potential of data analytics to support us in this exploratory journey.

In this webpage, I intend to detail my experiences using the Disciplined Agile Exploratory Life cycle and demonstrate how data analytics can provide invaluable insights to comprehend customers' needs and establish design guidelines, facilitating the creation of more personalized products. Upon completion of the exploration project, a predictive model was developed to determine the comfort index of the new headphone design, prior to the prototyping and testing stages.

Below 5 data analytic techniques were utilized during the course of the Comfortable Headphone exploratory project. These techniques were applied across the six activities of the DAD Exploratory Life cycle , which include Envision, Build a little, Deploy, Observe and measure, Cancel, and Productize. This website will primarily focus on the data analytic techniques employed during the project, and will not delve deeply into the DAD Exploratory Life cycle.
